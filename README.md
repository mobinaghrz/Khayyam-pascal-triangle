# Khayyam-pascal-triangle
The idea here is that we put the whole triangle in a line,
we skip line one and two  and print them righat away,
then for the rest we put a pointer that sum the two up numbers and put it in the middle number.

Linear Solution for Khayyam Pascal Triangle.py
 The algorithem in this file is to put the whole lines before in a linear list and calculate the whole triangle in a list, and afterward print it in a triangle


 Nth line of the pascal triangle.py
 it goase with formula of :
 for N th line :

N! / K! * (N-K)! 

Note: K is the choise from N.
